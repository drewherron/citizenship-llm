Preparing for the Naturalization Test A Pocket Study Guide 
Are you thinking about applying for naturalization? 
This pocket study guide will help you prepare for the naturalization test. If you were not born in the United States, naturalization is the way that you can voluntarily become a U.S. citizen. To become a naturalized U.S. citizen, you must pass the naturalization test. We’ve provided you with the civics test questions and answers, and the reading and writing vocabulary to help you study. 
Additionally, this guide contains general information on naturalization eligibility requirements on page 2. 
To learn about and study for the civics portion of the naturalization test, turn to page 5. 
To learn about and study for the English portion of the naturalization test, turn to page 27. 
You can find more resources to help you prepare in the back of the study guide on page 36.

General Eligibility Requirements 
Before you apply for naturalization, you must meet a few requirements. Depending on your situation, different requirements may apply to you. Below is a list of the general eligibility requirements.

For more information, visit A Guide to Naturalization at www.uscis.gov/natzguide. 

Citizenship Rights and Responsibilities 
Citizenship offers many benefits and equally important responsibilities. When you naturalize, you agree to accept all of the responsibilities of becoming a U.S. citizen. You agree to support the United States, its Constitution, and its laws. In return, you gain all the rights and privileges of citizenship such as the right to vote and travel with a U.S. passport. 

The Naturalization Test 
During your naturalization interview, a USCIS officer will ask you questions about your application and background. You will also take an English and civics test unless you qualify for an exemption or waiver. 

English Test 
The English test has three components: reading, writing, and speaking. For the reading test, you must read one out of three sentences correctly to demonstrate an ability to read in English. There is a reading vocabulary list on page 28 with all the words found in the English reading portion of the naturalization test. 
For the writing test, you must write one out of three sentences correctly to demonstrate an ability to write in English. There is a writing vocabulary list on page 31 with all the words found in the English writing portion of the naturalization test. 
Your ability to speak English is determined by the USCIS officer based on your answers to questions normally asked during the naturalization interview. 

Civics Test 
The civics test covers important U.S. history and government topics. There are 100 civics questions on the naturalization test. During your naturalization interview, you will be asked up to 10 questions from the list of 100 questions. You must answer correctly 6 of the 10 questions to pass the civics test. 

Retaking the Naturalization Test 
You have two opportunities to take the English and civics tests per application. If you fail any portion of the test during your first interview, you will be retested on the portion of the test that you failed at a second interview. USCIS will schedule you to return to be retested between 60 and 90 days after the date of your initial interview.

Exceptions 
Certain applicants, because of age and time as a permanent resident, are exempt from the English requirements for naturalization and may take the civics test in the language of their choice. For more information, visit www.uscis.gov/citizenship.

Study Materials for the Civics Portion of the Naturalization Test 

Civics (History and Government) Questions for the Naturalization Test 
The 100 civics (history and government) questions and answers for the naturalization test are listed on the following pages. The civics test is an oral test and the USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 of the 100 civics questions. You must answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly to pass the civics portion of the naturalization test. 
Some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to these questions. Answer these questions with the name of the official who is serving at the time of your eligibility interview with USCIS. The USCIS officer will not accept an incorrect answer.
Although USCIS is aware that there may be additional correct answers to the 100 civics questions, you are encouraged to respond to the civics questions using the answers provided in this pocket study guide. 

65/20 Civics Test Exemption

While the eligibility requirements and the subject material of the naturalization test have not changed, applicants can now use a stylus on a digital tablet instead of a paper application. USCIS will continue using the paper process on a case-by-case basis. Immigration Services Officers (ISO) will carefully instruct applicants on use of the tablets before administering the tests. Applicants will continue to take the civics test verbally, without the tablet.
