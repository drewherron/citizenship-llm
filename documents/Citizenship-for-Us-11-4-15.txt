The English Language Requirement 
According to United States (U.S.) law you must demonstrate “an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language” (Immigration and Nationality Act § 312(a)(1)). 

English Understanding and Speaking 
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) tests your ability to speak and understand English throughout the interview. Your English is being tested from the moment you first meet the officer and every time the officer speaks to you and waits for your response or action. 
USCIS Officer: How are you today? 
You: Fine, thank you. 
USCIS Officer: Is it still raining outside? 
You: Yes, it’s raining a lot! 
USCIS Officer: Are you here to become a U.S. citizen? 
You: Yes, I want to be a citizen. 
USCIS Officer: Please raise your right hand. 
Most of the questions are taken from the citizenship application (N-400) to confirm the truth of your answers. When preparing for the English test, it is very important to study a copy of the N-400 that you submitted and learn all the terms and vocabulary on it so that you can answer questions about your application. Be sure to study the questions found in Part 11 of the N-400. 
USCIS Officer: Have you ever registered to vote in any Federal, State, or local election in the United States? 
You: No. 
USCIS Officer: Have you ever not filed a Federal, State, or local tax return since you became a Permanent Resident? 
You: No, I’ve filed my tax returns every year.

What to Do if You Don’t Understand 
You can ask the officer to repeat the question, speak louder or slower, or use simpler words. USCIS officers are required to repeat and rephrase questions until they are satisfied that you either understand the questions or you do not understand English. 
USCIS Officer: Are you willing to bear arms on behalf of the United States?
You: Can you say that again slowly with simple words? 
USCIS Officer: Are you willing to serve in the U.S. military if the government calls you? 
You: Yes, I am. 

English Reading 
USCIS will ask you to read up to three sentences. The sentences will all be questions related to United States history and government, and will be based on a vocabulary list found on the USCIS website at: www.uscis.gov. The reading sentences are paired with the dictation (writing) sentences. There is no list of sample reading sentences to study before the test, only a list of vocabulary words that will be used in the sentences. 

How Your Reading is Evaluated 
You must be able to read at least one sentence correctly in order to pass the reading test. This means reading a sentence without long pauses and reading most of the words in the sentence. USCIS will not fail you because of your accent when reading. You may make pronunciation errors or leave out short words and still pass the test if the meaning of the sentence is clear. 

See Attachment A for a copy of the reading vocabulary list.

English Writing 
USCIS tests your writing ability by asking you to write up to three spoken (dictation) sentences. The sentences will all be related to United States history and government, and will be the answers to the questions you are asked to read for the English reading test. They will be taken from a writing vocabulary list found on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov. There is no list of sample sentences for you to study before the test, only a vocabulary list of words that will be used in the sentences.

Examples of English Reading and Writing Test: 
USCIS Officer: [Pointing] Please read this sentence. 
You: Who was the first President? 
USCIS Officer: Please write the sentence,“Washington was the first President.”
You: Washington was the first President. 
USCIS Officer: [Pointing] Please read this sentence. 
You: Where is the White House? 
USCIS Officer: Please write the sentence,“The White House is in Washington, D.C.” You: The White House is in Washington D.C. 

See Attachment B for a copy of the writing vocabulary list.

How Your Writing is Evaluated 
If you do not know every word in the sentence, write as much as you can. You will be given up to three chances to write an acceptable sentence. You must be able to write at least one acceptable sentence in order to pass the writing test. USCIS will use scoring guidelines to determine whether your sentence is acceptable. USCIS will accept some small errors in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation as long as the meaning of the sentence is still clear. In addition, USCIS will accept a sentence that is missing short words if the meaning of the sentence is still clear. Numbers can be spelled out or written as digits. However, USCIS will not accept any abbreviated words in the sentence. 

Example Sentences 
An example of a sentence with spelling errors: The American flag is red, wite, and blu. 
A sentence with capitalization errors: the american flag is red, white, and blue. 
A sentence with punctuation errors: The American flag is red white and blue 
A sentence missing short words: American flag is red, white, blue. 
A correctly written sentence: The American flag is red, white, and blue. 

See Attachment C for a copy of the USCIS scoring guidelines for the English test.

The History and Government Requirement 
According to the law, you must demonstrate “a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States” (Immigration and Nationality Act § 312(a)(2)). 

Sources of Information for the Test 
The test is based on a list of 100 study questions and answers which is found on the USCIS website at: www.uscis.gov. The questions are divided into nine subject areas: 
 • Principles of American Democracy
 • System of Government
 • Rights and Responsibilities
 • Colonial Period and Independence 
 • 1800s 
 • Geography 
 • Symbols 
 • Holidays 
 • Recent American History and Other Important Historical Information 
Many of the questions have several correct answers listed, but you only need to give one of them. For example: 
13. Name one branch or part of the government. 
 • legislative 
 • President 
 • executive 
 • the courts 
 • judicial 
 • Congress 
Other questions require you to give two or more answers. For example:
9. What are two rights in the Declaration of Independence? 
 • life 
 • liberty 
 • pursuit of happiness 
In addition, USCIS recognizes that some of the questions are more open-ended, and may have correct answers that are not given on the list. USCIS has trained officers on how to handle the open-ended questions, so as not to fail applicants who give a correct answer that is not listed. 

See Attachment D for a copy of the 100 study questions.

Phrasing of Questions 
The questions will be asked exactly as they are shown on the study list. However, the officer may choose to re-phrase a question to help you understand it. For example: 
• Name the U.S. war between the North and the South. 
• What do we call the war between the North and the South? 
• The war between the North and the South is called what? 

How USCIS Gives the Test 
The United States history and government test is an oral (spoken) test, so the USCIS officer will ask the questions out loud and you will give spoken answers. You are not required to read the questions or write your answers. 

How the History and Government Test is Evaluated 
You will be given up to 10 questions. You must answer at least six questions correctly to pass.

Words to Recognize 
Most of the questions begin with these words: 
How many…
What…
Who…
Why…
Name… 
Recognizing these words can help you answer the question correctly. 
How many refers to a number. 
Question: How many U.S. Senators are there? 
Answer: 100 
What usually refers to the name of a person, place, or thing. 
Question: What is the economic system in the United States?
Answer: Capitalist economy, market economy. 
Who usually refers to a person. 
Question: Who is the “Father of Our Country?” 
Answer:George Washington. 
Why asks you the reason for something. 
Question: Why does the flag have 13 stripes? 
Answer: Because there were 13 original colonies. 
Name usually asks you to give the name of a person, group of people, place, or event. 
Question: Name one American Indian tribe in the United States.
Answer: Cherokee.

Preparing for the Test
It is never too early to study for the test. The most common reason people are denied citizenship is for failing the test. There are many ways you can study. 

Classes 
Many adult schools and community centers offer citizenship test preparation classes. Studying with a teacher and other students is helpful to many people. 
Some things to consider when choosing a citizenship class: 
• Do you know anyone who went to the school? Did they like the class? Why or why not?
• What is the class schedule? How many weeks long is the class? How many hours per week? 
• Does the class content include English and history/government or only history/government? 
• How many levels or kinds of classes are offered? Does the school have a quick review class you can take right before your interview? Are there classes that meet your needs?
• Do the students in each class have a similar English level or are there many levels in one class? 
• Does the teacher speak your native language? Are there other people in the class who speak your language? 
• Where does the class meet? Is there adequate public transportation or parking? • Does the class provide you with a textbook or other materials you can take home and study? 
• Is the teacher a paid professional or a volunteer? How much experience and training does the teacher have? 
• Is there a fee for the class? How much does the class cost? 

Tutoring 
Some organizations provide tutors to help you study. Tutors are usually volunteers who have been trained. You may be tutored alone or in a small group. 
Some things to consider when choosing a tutor: 
• Is the tutor knowledgeable about citizenship and the test requirements?
• Can the tutor spend enough time with you so you will be prepared for the test? 
• Can you get a new tutor if you don’t do well with the one assigned to you?
• Does the tutor speak your language? 

Self-Study 
Many people choose to study by themselves. Even if you do take a class or work with a tutor, you will need to do some studying by yourself. 
Some things to consider in studying by yourself: 
• Do you have the discipline to study regularly? 
• Have you set aside a special time to study? 
• Do you have a place you can concentrate without distractions like TV, people, or other noise? 
• Do you need someone you can ask questions to or discuss topics with? • Do you have someone who can quiz you? 

Tips for Studying: 
• Practice answering questions out loud. 
• Post written questions and answers around your house in places you are likely to see them such as your refrigerator or the bathroom mirror. 
• Use memory techniques. For example, make up a song or a poem with important information. 
• Have family and friends help you. Have them give you dictations, quiz you on the 100 questions or go through a sample interview from beginning to end. Make sure they phrase questions in many different ways. For example: Have you filed your income tax every year? Have you ever failed to file your income tax? Do you pay your taxes? Did you fail to pay your taxes any year? 
• Use index cards. On one side write a question and on the other side write the answer. Or, on one side write a vocabulary word and on the other side its meaning. USCIS has flash cards for the reading and writing vocabulary words and the history/government questions that you can print from its website. You can find those and other study materials at www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/study-test. 
• Underline or highlight key words on the N-400. Study those words so you can recognize the question when you hear those words.

Unit One
European Exploration, American Indians, and the English Colonies in North America 

European Exploration
Section Glossary of Terms
Explorer 
A person who travels long distances to find new places
Trader 
A person who makes a living by exchanging goods, instead of buying and selling with money 
 
Christopher Columbus was a European explorer and trader. He wanted to trade for gold, silk, and spices in Asia. Travel by land from Europe to Asia was very slow. It was dangerous to sail around Africa. Columbus thought he could get to Asia directly by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. 
Columbus left Spain to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain paid for his trip. Columbus and his crew set sail on three ships: the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. 
For many years, Europeans did not know North America existed. 
Currier & Ives , 1892 | Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, LC-USZC2-3385Columbus reached the Bahamas in October of 1492. 
On October 12, 1492, Columbus reached some islands in the Caribbean Sea. Columbus thought he was in India. He called the native people who lived there Indians (Indios). What he had really found was part of the Bahamas – islands close to the United States. 
Later, people realized that Columbus had come to a place that the Europeans did not know. It was a New World. An Italian explorer named Amerigo Vespucci said it was a new continent. The New World was named America in his honor. 


American Indians 
Section Glossary of Terms 
American Indian 
The original people who lived in the Americas before the Europeans 
Tribes 
Groups of Native Americans who share a common culture, language, and land 

American Indians lived in America before the Europeans arrived. Many American Indians came to the Americas by walking across a land bridge from Asia thousands of years ago. Today, there are many different American Indian tribes.
Six tribes and how to pronounce their names: 
Apache (uh-patch-ee)
Arawak (ar-uh-wak)
Inuit (in-yoo-it) 
Iroquois (ir-uh-kwoi)
Oneida (oh-nahy-duh)
Sioux (soo)

Cheyenne
Chippewa 
Choctow
Creek 
Crow 
Hopi 
Huron 
Lakota 
Mohegan
Navajo
Pueblo 
Seminole
Shawnee
Teton 
There are many other American Indian tribes, and USCIS officer will have a list of all federally recognized tribes. 

Edward S. Curtis , 1905 | Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, LC-USZC4-12466American Indians lived in America before the Europeans arrived. 
With the arrival of Europeans, life became more difficult for the American Indians. Some were forced to work as slaves. Others died fighting in defense of their land. They used simple weapons like bows and arrows against the Europeans’ guns. European diseases also killed many American Indians. Some tribes died out, but others still survive. As Americans moved West in the 1800s, they forced American Indians off their land. Many American Indians died because of this policy or in wars between American Indian tribes and the United States army. 

The British Colonies in North America

Section Glossary of Terms 
Colony 
Land owned and governed by a dominant country; colonists are people who live in that land 
Persecution 
Treating someone badly 
Pilgrims 
People who traveled to the American colonies from England in search of religious freedom 

Boughton, 1867 | Prints and Photographs Division, Library of CongressThe Pilgrims immigrated for freedom of religion. 
In 1607, the first permanent English colony was founded in Jamestown, Virginia. The colonists grew and traded tobacco. The colonists left England because they wanted religious freedom, political liberty, economic opportunity, and to escape persecution. It was difficult to survive as settlers building new homes and farming the wilderness. 
In 1620, the Pilgrims formed a colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts. They sailed to the colony across the Atlantic Ocean on a ship called the Mayflower. 
The first winter was very hard for the Pilgrims. It was very cold and they had no food. Half of the Pilgrims died that winter. Friendly Native Americans helped the Pilgrims by teaching them about farming, fishing, and hunting. 
The next fall, the Pilgrims celebrated Thanksgiving. It was the first American holiday. The Pilgrims invited the Native Americans to a big meal. They gave thanks to God for their food and a year of peace. 
Today, we celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday in November. Much of the food we eat is native to the Americas: turkey, pumpkin, corn, cranberries, and sweet potatoes. 
The last of the 13 colonies was established in 1732. The 13 colonies were along the eastern coast of what is now the United States. They were Virginia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Georgia. These colonies later became the first 13 states.

Joseph-Siffred Duplessis, 1785 | National Portrait Gallert, Washington D.C. 
King George III of Great Britian and Ireland governed the 13 colonies in America. He required the colonies to trade only with Great Britain. The colonies had to sell their goods to Great Britain for low prices. They could buy manufactured goods only from the British. The colonies also had to pay many taxes. 
Benjamin Franklin was an American inventor, writer, and politician. 
King George ruled Great Britain and the 13 colonies. 
Allan Ramsay, 1765 | Art Gallery of South Australia
Many colonists thought that the British laws were unfair. Taxes were high, the colonists had to allow British soldiers to stay in their homes, and the colonists did not have self-government. They protested against the laws. Great Britain passed a tax on tea in 1773. A group of colonists in Boston got very angry. They secretly dumped 90,000 pounds of British tea into the ocean. This was called the Boston Tea Party. 
Leading protesters from the colonies met. They wanted to solve their problems with Great Britain. They wrote a letter to the King. They asked him to stop the taxes and let them trade freely. 
The Revolutionary War began in 1775. The King of Great Britain did not listen to the protesters or change the rules for trade and taxation. Many of the colonists decided it was time to fight for independence.
Rembrandt Peale, 1800 | White House Historical Association 
On July 4, 1776, representatives from all 13 colonies adopted the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson wrote the document. It explained the problems between the colonies and the King of Great Britain. It also declared that America was independent from Great Britain. 
The basic belief of the Declaration of Independence is that “all men are created equal” and have certain important rights. These include “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Every July 4th, people in the United States celebrate Independence Day. 
George Washington was the Commander in Chief (leader) of the colonial Army. He was the first Commander in Chief of the United States military.

After the Revolutionary War, the Founding Fathers, leaders from the new states, gathered at the Constitutional Convention and wrote the Constitution. The Constitution is the plan of government for the United States. It was written in 1787, and the 13 state governments voted to accept its authority. 
The Founding Fathers wanted to explain the plan of government to the people so that they would support it and vote for the Constitution. The Federalist Papers were 85 essays that explained how the American form of government would work and why it was the best system of government for the new nation. The essays were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, but they were published under the name “Publius.” 
The Constitution defines the government of the United States and creates three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch includes the President and his/her Cabinet advisors, the legislative branch is the Senators and Representatives, and the judicial branch is the judges and courts. Each branch has certain powers. The founding fathers did not want one person or branch to have too much power. This system is called separation of powers, or a system of checks and balances. 
The Constitution gives a voice in the government to both big and small states. The legislative branch of Congress has two parts, the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the Senate, each state has two senators. In the House of Representatives, each state has representation based on its population. States with more people have more representatives than smaller states. This is one reason it is important to be counted in the census every ten years. 
The Constitution gives some powers to the federal government and some to state government. The federal government has the power to print money, declare war, create an army, and make treaties. The state governments have the power to provide education, protection, and safety; to give driver’s licenses; and to approve zoning and land use. 
The first three words of the Constitution, called the Preamble, explain the American idea of self-government. The Preamble reads: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”

More About Benjamin Franklin 
Benjamin Franklin was an early supporter of the idea that the 13 colonies should be united into one nation. Franklin became famous as a writer, scientist, and politician. He wrote “Poor Richard’s Almanac,” a yearly publication that provided a calendar, information about the weather, and entertainment. He was the oldest member of the Constitutional Convention and a U.S. diplomat in France. He was also the first Postmaster General of the United States and started the first free libraries in the country.
Benjamin Franklin is known for his experiments with electricity. 

Amendments 
Amendments are changes to the Constitution. Amendments can be added in two ways. One way is for two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for the change. The other way is for Congress to call a special convention. A total of 27 amendments have been added to the Constitution since 1787. 
The founding fathers wrote a Bill of Rights in 1791. The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments or changes to the Constitution. It defines individual and community rights that protect many of the activities of American life. The document provides a guide for how all people who live in the United States can participate in and benefit from democracy. 
The Constitution and Bill of Rights together protect the basic rights of Americans and all people living in the United States. The Constitution is called, “the supreme law of the land.”

In 1812, England and the United States were at war again (the War of 1812). The English burned the White House and the Capitol Building. One night, England attacked Fort McHenry, a military fortress in Baltimore, Maryland. Francis Scott Key was a lawyer from Baltimore. He saw the fortress being attacked. He did not know who was winning the battle. The next morning, he saw the United States flag still flying over the fortress. Francis Scott Key was inspired to write the words of the Star Spangled Banner. Later, he put the words to the music of a popular song. The “Star Spangled Banner” became the national anthem of the United States

Percy Moran, 1913 | Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, LC-DIG-ds-00032a Francis Scott Key was inspired to write the words of the Star Spangled Banner during the War of 1812.
The lyrics to the first verse of the Star Spangled Banner are: 
 Oh say can you see by the dawn’s early light, 
 What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming, 
 Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, 
 O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? 
 And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
 Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; 
 Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, 
 O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

The Statue of Liberty was the first thing many immigrants from Europe saw when they arrived in the United States. 
The statue is of a woman with long robes and a crown. In her right hand she carries a torch. In her left hand she has a book that reads July 4, 1776. On her feet there is a broken chain that symbolizes breaking out of oppression. Below the statue’s feet is a poem written by an immigrant named Emma Lazarus: 
“Give me your tired, your poor, 
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The United States is a large country that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast to the Pacific Ocean on the West Coast. It shares a border with Canada to the North and with Mexico to the South. There are 48 contiguous states on the North American continent, plus the peninsula of Alaska and the islands of Hawaii. 
The capital of the United States is Washington, DC. 
In addition to the 50 states and Washington, DC, the United States has a number of territories. Territories are governed by the United States government but they have less legal and political power than states. They do not have a vote in Congress. People born in some United States territories are U.S. citizens, but in other territories they are not. The most well known United States territories are Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. 
The United States is the third largest country in the world. It has many major geographic landmarks. The longest rivers are the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. There are five “Great Lakes” in the north-central part of the country. There are also many mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains are the longest mountain range in the country.

Harper’s Weekly, 1975 | Prints and Photographs Div., Lib. of Congress, LC-USZ61-1423 African American slaves worked on farms and plantations long hours for no pay.
By 1860, the southern and the northern states were different in many ways. The South’s economy was from farming while the North’s was more industrial. The South grew a lot of cotton and tobacco. Southern farmers needed many people to work. Both large plantations and small farms used slaves as workers. 
Slaves were people captured in Africa and sold to slave traders. They were forced to come to America in crowded ships. They were sold to new owners and they and their children were kept as property. Slaves were forced to work long hours for no pay and often with harsh physical punishment. 
Africans first came to the United States in the 1600s. Some were free and others were slaves. Later, the northern states made slavery illegal. By 1860, the United States had four million slaves in the South. 
During the Civil War (1861-1865), the northern states formed the Union and the southern states formed the Confederacy.
The northern and southern states had many disagreements over slavery, economics, and states’ rights. Many people in the South believed they needed slaves. Some people in the North wanted to end slavery. Because the North had more people, it had more representatives in Congress. Congress passed laws that helped the northern states grow, but hurt the southern economy. The expansion of new states in the Union made the debate on slavery more important. 
The Civil War, also called “The War Between the States,” began soon after Abraham Lincoln was elected President. Many southern states were angry because Lincoln was personally against slavery and also from the North. The Civil War began in 1861 after eleven southern states separated from the Union (the United States) and formed the Confederacy, a new government of slave owning states. 
Alexander Gardner, 1863 | Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, LC-DIG-ppmsca-19301 Abraham Lincoln was President during the Civil War. 
The Civil War lasted from 1861 to 1865. The northern Union government wanted to reunite the country. The southern Confederate government wanted to remain separate. As leader of the United States during the war, Lincoln was the Commander-in-Chief of the Union army. 
In 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This document started the process of freeing the slaves in the Confederate states. The 13th amendment to the Constitution was passed in 1865. It prohibited slavery. 
The North won the war in 1865 and the United States became unified again. President Lincoln was responsible for saving the Union. Shortly after, Lincoln was murdered. 
President’s Day is a national holiday celebrating the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln (February 12) and George Washington (February 22). On the third Monday in February, people in the United States remember these leaders.

The United States grew from 13 to 50 states. When George Washington became President, the Mississippi River was the western border of the United States. By the mid 1850s, the country covered all the land from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. 
Alaska and Hawaii were the last states to join the Union. They joined in 1959. Alaska was the 49th state and Hawaii was the 50th state. 
The United States also has non-state territories. People born in the territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands are U.S. citizens. 
All of the land that is now the United States was owned by the American Indians when the first explorers arrived. American settlers claimed and farmed much of the American Indians’ land for themselves. 
The United States government bought much of North America from European countries. In 1803 the government bought the Louisiana Territory (land west of the Mississippi River) from France called the Louisiana Purchase. Then, in 1819 the United States bought Florida from Spain. Finally, Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867. 
The United States gained the Northwestern Territories (Oregon Country) in 1846 from England. England kept what is now the province of British Columbia in western Canada. 
The southwestern states were colonies of Spain, and then were part of an independent Mexico before they became part of the United States. In 1845, the United States took over Texas. This angered many Mexicans. The United States and Mexico fought the Mexican-American War as a result. It ended with the United States taking control over most of the southwest. In 1853, the United States government bought a piece of land from Mexico called the Gadsden Purchase. 
By the 1890s, the United States was the main power in the Western Hemisphere, but Spain still had colonies in the Caribbean. The Spanish-American War started when Spain sunk an American ship in Cuba. The war ended when the United States Navy destroyed the Spanish Navy in the Philippines and Cuba. In this war, the United States won control of the Spanish colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam.

The 20th Century and Today 

The 20th Century and Today 
The 20th century began and ended with large waves of immigration to the United States. From 1900 to 1910 the United States had its highest decade of immigration, nearly all from Europe. In the 1920s, the government passed a law that limited immigration for many years. However, in 1965 a new law opened up immigration to people from all over the world based on family sponsorship. As a result, the United States experienced its second highest decade of immigration during the 1980s. This time the majority of the immigrants were from Asia and Latin America. Except for the Native Americans, all people in the United States have an immigrant heritage. 
World War I began in 1914, but the United States did not enter the war until 1917. Woodrow Wilson was President during this time. It was the first war using modern weapons such as submarines, tanks and airplanes. The United States helped England, France and Russia defeat a group of countries led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. The war ended in 1918. 
Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, LC-USW33- 035391-ZC Breadline during the Great Depression.
In 1929, the United States and the rest of the world entered into an economic depression called the “Great Depression.” The stock market dropped. Many businesses closed and people lost their jobs or had their salaries cut. Many banks permanently closed and people lost their money. The depression gradually ended by 1939. 
President Franklin Roosevelt helped end the Great Depression with the New Deal. Roosevelt was first elected President in 1932 and served until 1945. 
In the New Deal, the government gave jobs to the unemployed, provided loans to prevent farmers and homeowners from losing their property, and passed laws to protect against another depression. In addition, many bank accounts were guaranteed from bankruptcy by the government.

The United States entered World War II after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. 
World War II began in 1939. The United States entered World War II in 1941 on the day after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. More than 2,000 people died in the attack. The United States joined the Allied powers—England, Russia, and other countries—against the Axis powers led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. 
The United States and the Allied countries won World War II in 1945. During the war, they defeated Germany months after the famous D-Day invasion in Normandy, France in 1944. Japan did not surrender until after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who later became President of the United States, commanded the United States army during World War II. 
The United Nations was born after the terrible experience of World War II. During World War II, more than 22 million people died. Many countries thought it was important to come together to try and resolved world problems peacefully. They formed a new international organization called the United Nations (UN). The UN also helps many countries with economic assistance and provides education and health problems.

World War II ended when the United States dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan.
After World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States – the two major world powers – became involved in the Cold War. The United States and Western European democratic countries, who opposed communism, led one side. In these countries, the people chose the leaders of their government and could also own private property. The Soviet Union led the communist Eastern European countries. Under the Soviet system, the Communist Party ran the government and private property was not allowed. Both sides influenced other countries around the world during the Cold War. 
The Cold War was a war for the political support and economic markets of developing countries. It did not involve actual fighting between the superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union, although each side had many weapons in its military. 
In the early 1990s, the Cold War ended as the Soviet Union and other communist countries moved toward democracy. Today, there are fewer communist countries left in the world. 
In the Korean War, the United States tried to defend the non-communist government in South Korea from the communist government in North Korea. The war lasted from 1950 to 1953. At the end of the war, Korea remained divided with an unstable peace.

The United States also tried to protect anti-communist South Vietnam from Communist North Vietnam. The United States was involved in the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1973. The United States government sent troops to help the South Vietnamese. 
The Vietnam War was controversial in the United States. Americans strongly debated whether or not the United States should be involved in Vietnam. The people against the war marched and demonstrated all over the country, attracting a lot of attention from the media. 
The United States withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973. In 1975 the North Vietnam military invaded the South and united the country under communist leadership. 
After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United States led a group of countries to help free Kuwait. Iraq left Kuwait and the United States and its allies won the Persian Gulf War quickly in February 1991.

Discrimination 
An act or behavior against someone due to color of skin, accent, or some other difference 

The civil rights movement tried to end discrimination against African Americans and other minorities during the 1950s and 1960s. Although they were freed from slavery, African Americans continued to suffer from discrimination. In some parts of the country, they were segregated or separated from white people in schools, restaurants, restrooms, and other public places. In addition, some state laws made it very difficult for them to register to vote. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the most famous leader of the civil rights movement among many courageous leaders. Through his peaceful protests against discriminatory laws, he worked for equality for all Americans and inspired people throughout the United States and the world. For his work, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
As a result of the civil rights movement, many new laws were passed against discrimination. These laws helped women, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic minority groups claim their constitutional rights.

On August 28, 1963 more than 100,000 people marched in Washington, DC to demand civil rights. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a famous speech. The speech was called “I Have a Dream.” Here is part of that speech. 
“I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American meaning…We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day…sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood…I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but the content of their character… This is our hope…With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, knowing that we will be free one day…And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true…”

The Legislative Branch of the Federal Government 
Lawrence Jackson, 2009 | whitehouse.gov
Laws are debated by the Representatives in the House Chamber. 
The legislative branch of government is called Congress. Congress makes the federal laws for the United States. 
Congress meets in Washington, DC at the United States Capitol Building. Washington, DC is the capital of the United States. 
Congress is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Senators work in the Senate and Representatives work in the House of Representatives. This is called a bicameral legislature (two houses). 
It is the duty of Congress to write bills and vote on them. After a bill passes both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the President may sign it into law or reject it. The judicial branch makes sure the law is constitutional. The executive branch puts the new federal law into effect. For example, only Congress has the power to declare war, but the President is the Commander in Chief of the military. 
There are 100 Senators in the Senate. Each state has two Senators. Senators serve a six year term of office. Every six years there is a new election. There is no limit on how many times a Senator can be re-elected. A Senator represents all the people of a state. 
There are a total of 435 voting members in the House of Representatives. The total of 435 remains the same according to the Constitution, but the number of Representatives from each state varies. It depends on the population of each state. States with a lot of people have many Representatives. States with small populations have fewer Representatives. Each Representative represents people from a certain part of the state. Representatives serve a two year term of office. Every two years there is a new election. There is no limit on how many times a Representative can be re-elected.

The executive branch enforces federal laws and puts new laws into effect. The legislative branch makes laws and then the executive branch puts them into effect through the appropriate department or independent agency. 
The executive branch is made up of the President, the Vice President, and the Cabinet and their departments. It also has some independent agencies. 
The President is in charge of the executive branch. The Presidency is the highest office in the United States. The President is the leader of the country and the Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces. The President nominates judges to the Supreme Court and signs bills into laws. The President can also veto laws. 
According to the Constitution, the President can only serve for two full, consecutive terms. Each term is four years, so the President can serve a total of eight years. 
The White House is the President’s official home. The White House is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20500. 

The President’s Cabinet 
The Cabinet is a special group of people who advise the President. They are appointed or nominated by the President. Each cabinet member is the head of an executive department. Except for the head of the Justice Department, who is called the Attorney General, the head of each executive department is called the Secretary. In the United States, Cabinet-level positions are: 
• Attorney General 
• Secretary of Agriculture
• Secretary of Commerce 
• Secretary of Defense 
• Secretary of Education 
• Secretary of Energy 
• Secretary of Health and Human Services 
• Secretary of Homeland Security
• Secretary of the Interior 
• Secretary of Labor 
• Secretary of State 
• Secretary of Transportation
• Secretary of the Treasury
• Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs
• Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 

The Vice President is the second highest position in the country. He or she leads the Senate and votes in case of a tie. The Vice President serves as the acting President if the President is unable to serve. 
If the President should die or leave office, the Vice President would become the President. If both the President and the Vice President cannot serve, the leader of the House of Representatives, called the Speaker of the House, becomes President. 
The President and the Vice President must have the same qualifications according to the Constitution. The President must be born a U.S. citizen, be at least 35 years old, and have lived in the United States at least 14 years.

Presidential Elections 
Master Sgt. Cecilio Ricardo, U.S. Air Force, 2009 On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama, a Democrat, was sworn in as President at his inauguration.
The President is elected every four years in November. The general election is always held in November. People can vote for the candidate of their choice. 
The President is not directly elected by the people, but rather by the electoral college. The electoral college meets after the election votes are counted. Representatives from the electoral colleges from each state vote for the candidate who won the majority vote in their state. 
The people vote for a candidate from the Democratic or Republican party or from an independent party. A party is a group of people with similar ideas about government. The Democratic and Republican parties are the largest in the United States. 
The presidential candidates are chosen by their party. The candidates first run in primary elections in different states. Then, each party has a convention at which they choose their candidate for President. Usually the person who won the most votes in the primary is picked. Then the presidential candidate picks a vice presidential candidate. The party candidates for President and Vice President campaign together. 
The candidate who is elected President in November is inaugurated in January. The winner must wait until January to be sworn in as President of the United States.

Each state has its own government. State governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. State law is based on the state constitution.
A governor is the head of the executive branch of state government. The governor’s office is in the state capital. The governor gives the state senators and representatives ideas about what laws are needed. The governor can also veto or reject bills he or she does not like. The governor appoints judges to state courts and is the leader of the state’s National Guard.
The executive branch also has independent agencies. For example, one agency can regulate driver’s licenses and another can provide public assistance to low-income people.
The state legislative branch is made up of the state senate and house of representatives. It is often called either the state legislature or the state assembly. It makes state laws, decides how much state tax to charge, and decides what to do with the taxes collected. The state legislature passes laws on issues such as state highways and state support for public education.
Each state decides how many senators and representatives to have and how to elect them.The state has senate districts from which senators are elected and assembly districts from which representatives are elected. They all meet together in the state capital.
The judicial branch of state government is made up of the state courts. The state courts hear cases about state laws. There is also a state supreme court.
A judge and jury hear most cases in the court system. The jury decides by vote if the person is guilty as accused. The jury may also recommend to the judge what sentence to give. Only U.S. citizens can serve on a jury.
State governments are responsible for issuing driver’s licenses.

Local Government
Counties, cities, towns, and villages have a local government. The state constitution gives procedures on how to establish a local government.
Each state is divided into counties. Counties usually have an elected board of commissioners or supervisors. Some counties also have a county manager.
City, town and village governments can charge and collect taxes, try people accused of breaking local laws, and provide government services. Services may include police and fire protection; garbage collection; marriage, birth and death certificates; and school and public library administration.
The head executive of city government is usually an elected mayor. Many cities also have an elected city council which acts like the legislative branch.

Public schools are often administered by local governments.

Miranda Rights
Miranda Rights are the result of two important Supreme Court cases. In the first case, a poor man named Clarence Gideon was arrested and charged with a crime. He asked the court to give him a lawyer for free because he could not afford one. The court said no because the crime was not punishable by death. Gideon asked the Supreme Court to hear his case. The Supreme Court decided that anyone accused of a crime for which he or she could receive a sentence of one year or more in jail should have a lawyer. If the person cannot afford one, he or she must be given one for free by the government.
In the second case, a man named Ernesto Miranda was arrested for rape. The police officer asked many questions to Miranda while he was alone without a lawyer. He signed a paper from the police officer that said he was guilty. Miranda thought the Constitution guaranteed him the right to be told he could have a lawyer when the police asked him questions. Miranda also asked the Supreme Court to hear his case. The Supreme Court agreed with Miranda. The evidence taken before he was told of his rights could not be used in his trial.
Today, police officers have to warn you of your constitutional rights if they arrest you. However, it is important to remember that anything you say or write either before or after you are arrested can be used against you in court.

The Miranda Warning
You have the right to remain silent and not say anything which might incriminate [hurt] yourself. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You can stop answering questions asked you at anytime. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning or when you go to court. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed [given] to you.

Everyone who lives in the United States has certain rights. They include freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to petition the government, freedom of worship, and the right to bear arms. The economic system in the United States, called a capitalist economy or market economy, provides all people who live in the United States the opportunity to pursue their economic goals. All people who live in the United States are subject to the “rule of law.” This means that everyone must obey the law, including leaders and the government.
Most people living in the United States have certain responsibilities even if they are not U.S. citizens. These responsibilities include paying income taxes and filing tax returns with the government. By law, employers must take federal income taxes out of employees’ paychecks. In some states, employers are also required to take state income taxes out of employees’ paychecks. The last day to send in federal income tax forms is April 15.
All men between the ages of 18 and 26 who live in the United States must register for Selective Service (the draft) when they turn 18. Failure to pay taxes and register with the Selective Service may delay or prevent a person from becoming a U.S. citizen.

Rights and Responsibilities of U.S. Citizens

Persuade

Instrumental
Of great importance

When you become a U.S. citizen you will make certain promises. You will promise to:
• Give up loyalty to other countries
• Defend the Constitution and laws of the United States
• Obey the laws of the United States
• Serve in the United States military (if needed)
• Do important work for the nation (if needed)
• Be loyal to the United States
Citizens of the United States have certain rights as a result of their citizenship. These include the right to vote, carry a United States passport, run for office and apply for certain federal jobs. It is much easier for U.S. citizens to help family members immigrate to the United States.
The right to vote is the most important right granted to a U.S. citizen. When the Constitution was written, not all U.S. citizens had the right to vote. Women, minorities, and people who could not afford to pay a poll tax were not allowed to vote. Voting rights were expanded by four amendments to the Constitution. These amendments say that:
• A male citizen of any race can vote (15th Amendment)
• Any citizen can vote (both men and women) (19th Amendment)
• You do not have to pay a poll tax to vote (24th Amendment)
• Citizens age 18 and older can vote (26th Amendment)

The Voting Rights Act
The four voting rights amendments to the Constitution did not prevent discrimination in voting. Many people, especially African-Americans, were not able to vote, even though they had the legal right to vote. Under some state laws, they had to take reading and writing tests and pay poll taxes in order to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 tried to end these practices by saying any law that denies a person the right to vote is illegal.
Citizens of the United States also have responsibilities. They are expected to vote and they are expected to serve on a jury if called to do so. These responsibilities are part of participating in a democracy. Other ways U.S. citizens can participate in a democracy include:
• Joining a civic or community group
• Giving an elected official their opinion on an issue
• Writing to a newspaper about an issue or policy
• Publicly supporting or opposing an issue or policy
• Joining a political party
• Helping with a political campaign
• Running for public office
There are many ways you can participate in the civic life of your community and live outthe promises you make when you become a citizen.

An Active Citizen
Susan B. Anthony was a committed participant in American democracy. She fought for civil rights and women’s rights. Along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony gave speeches around the country to try to persuade the government to treat men and women equally. Although she died before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was passed, she was instrumental in helping women get the right to vote.

SCORING GUIDELINES FOR THE U.S. NATURALIZATION TEST
Section 312 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that most applicants for naturalization demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language, as well as a knowledge of U.S. government and history (civics). This document provides a general description of how the U.S. Naturalization Test is evaluated and scored by Officers of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

SPEAKING: An applicant’s verbal skills are determined by the applicant’s answers to questions normally asked by USCIS Officers during the naturalization eligibility interview. USCIS Officers are required to repeat and rephrase questions until the Officer is satisfied that the applicant either fully understands the question or does not understand English. If the applicant generally understands and can respond meaningfully to questions relevant to the determination of eligibility, the applicant has demonstrated the ability to speak English.

READING: To sufficiently demonstrate the ability to read in English, applicants must read one sentence, out of three sentences, in a manner suggesting to the USCIS Officer that the applicant appears to understand the meaning of the sentence. Once the applicant reads one of three sentences correctly, USCISprocedures require that the USCIS Officer will stop administering the reading test. Applicants shall not be failed because of their accent when speaking English. A general description of how the reading test is scored follows:
Pass:
• Reads one sentence without extended pauses
• Reads all content words but may omit short words that do not interfere with meaning
• May make pronunciation or intonation errors that do not interfere with meaning
Fail:
• Does not read the sentence
• Omits a content word or substitutes another word for a content word
• Pauses for extended periods of time while reading the sentence
• Makes pronunciation or intonation errors that interfere with meaning
The English language requirement may be waived for an applicant, who on the date of filing the Application for Naturalization, Form N-400, was over 50 years old and has been a permanent resident for at least 20 years, or was over 55 years old and has been a permanent resident for at least 15 years. If either exemption applies, the applicant is not tested in English and may take the civics examination in the applicant’s language of choice. An applicant, who on the date of filing the application, was over 65 years old and has been a permanent resident for 20 years, is not tested in English and qualifies to take a simpler version of the civics test in the applicant’s language of choice. Also, both the English language and civics requirements for naturalization are waived for applicants who are unable to comply with these requirements because of a medical or physical impairment. To achieve a passing score on the civics test, applicants are required to answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly.

WRITING: To sufficiently demonstrate the ability to write in English, the applicant must write one sentence, out of three sentences, in a manner that would be understandable as written to the USCIS Officer. An applicant must not abbreviate any dictated word in the written sentence. Once the applicant writes one of three sentences correctly, USCIS procedures require that the USCIS Officer will stop administering the writing test. An applicant shall not be failed because of spelling, capitalization, or punctuation errors unless the errors would prevent understanding the meaning of the sentence. A general description of how the writing portion is scored follows:
Pass:
• Has the same general meaning as the dictated sentence
• May contain some grammatical, spelling, punctuation, or capitalization errors that do not interfere with meaning
• May omit short words that do not interfere with meaning
• Numbers may be spelled out or written as digits
Fail:
• Writes nothing or only one or two isolated words
• Is completely illegible
• Writes a different sentence or words
• Written sentence does not communicate the meaning of the dictated sentence
• Writes an abbreviation for a dictated word

CIVICS: To sufficiently demonstrate knowledge of U.S. government and history (civics), the applicant must answer six of ten questions correctly. The civics test will be an oral examination. Once the applicant answers six questions correctly, USCIS procedures require that the USCIS Officer will stop administering the civics test. A general description of how the civics portion is scored follows:
Pass:
• Provides a correct answer
• Provides an alternative phrasing of the correct answer
Fail:
• Provides an incorrect answer
• Fails to respond

According to regulation, applicants who fail the English literacy and/or civics test during their first examination will be rescheduled to appear for a second opportunity to take the test (8 CFR 312.5).

Attachment D
Civics (History and Government) Questions for the Naturalization Test (rev. 03/11)

The 100 civics (history and government) questions and answers for the naturalization test are listed below. The civics test is an oral test and the USCIS Officer will ask the applicant up to 10 of the 100 civics questions. An applicant must answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly to pass the civics portion of the naturalization test.
On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to these questions. Answer these questions with the name of the official who is serving at the time of your eligibility interview with USCIS. The USCIS Officer will not accept an incorrect answer.
Although USCIS is aware that there may be additional correct answers to the 100 civics questions, applicants are encouraged to respond to the civics questions using the answers provided below.
* If you are 65 years old or older and have been a legal permanent resident of the United States for 20 or more years, you may study just the questions that have been marked with an asterisk.
